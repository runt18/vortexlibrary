Vortex Library is an implementation of the RFC 3080 / RFC 3081 standard definitions, known as the BEEP Core protocol, implemented on top of the TCP/IP stack, using C language.

The project also includes a general BEEP server built on top of Vortex called Turbulence, and other BEEP stacks for languages like python (PyVortex), javascript (jsVortex) or Lua (LuaVortex).
